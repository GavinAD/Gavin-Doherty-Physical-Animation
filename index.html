        <p>
            The story revolves around the main character, Sherliy, who travels through time to show the audience historical events that have helped develop
            the current climate surrouding race.  As she attempts to inform the viewers, she faces resistance from Karen, another time traveler.

        <h3>Characters, Set, and Mechanical Designs<h3>
        <p>
            The creation of the characters was started by digitally drawing them.  A base was first drawn, allowing multiple variations of the characters to be created, 
            such as different facial expressions and size of the character.  These different variations were then printed and cut out.  Using different parts of the 
            variations we were able to have the characters move.  The sets of the animation were created using drawings.  These were drawn and colored using 
            colored penils.
