        <h2>Storyboard Explanaiton</h2>
        <p>
            The story revolves around the main character, Sherliy, who travels through time to show the audience historical events that have helped develop
            the current climate surrounding race.  As she attempts to inform the viewers, she faces resistance from Karen, another time traveler.

        <h2>Characters, Set, and Mechanical Designs</h2>
        <p>
            The creation of the characters was started by digitally drawing them.  A base was first drawn, allowing multiple variations of the characters to be created, 
            such as different facial expressions and size of the character.  These different variations were then printed and cut out.  Using different parts of the 
            variations we were able to have the characters move.  The sets of the animation were created using drawings.  These were drawn and colored using 
            colored pencils.  A camera mounted to the table which we were filming on.  This was to keep the camera steady and to decrease the amount of unwanted change
            from frame to frame as possible.
        </p>
        <h2>Code and Technology used in Our Animation</h2>
        <p>
            We used an Adafruit CRICKIT to add lighting to our animation.  We used code that allowed us to change the kind of light that was displayed using the buttons
            on the device.  This allowed us to use the same code to provide a variety of different lightings.
